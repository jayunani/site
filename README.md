# Food Oasis

This is a website with list of resources about food deserts and health. You can view the site here…
https://foodoasisla.github.io/site

## How to make changes to the site

The site is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and the website files are generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

### Step 1: Install Jekyll

To use Jekyll, you’ll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Once you have Ruby installed, you can install Jekyll from your terminal with this command…

```
gem install jekyll
```

### Step 2: Make your changes

Check out the `master` branch of this project and make your changes.

### Step 3: Commit your changes to `master`

### Step 4: Generate the site with Jekyll

Run this command…

```
jekyll build
```

### Step 5: Publish

When you generate the site, Jekyll creates a folder called `_site` within your project folder.

To publish your changes…

1. Move the `_site` folder out of your project to a temporary location.
2. Switch to the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Overwrite the files in your project with the contents of the `_site` folder.

Now push your changes to the `gh-pages` branch. And you’re done!
